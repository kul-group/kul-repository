# H and H2 in Uranium oxide Grain boundaries
This repository contains final structures in [ASE Databases](https://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/ase/ase/db/db.html) for the paper titled "Electronic and Geometric Contributors to Hydrogen Binding in Uranium Oxide Grain Boundaries". 

Following DBs can be found:
1. SI_bare_crystal.db: Contains conventional UO2 crystal 
3. SI_crystal_w_h.db: FCC UO2 crystal has 2 possible hydrogen binding sites namely tetrahedral and octahedral sites. This DB conatins H at each sites	
2. SI_bare_gb.db: Three prominent CSL GBs in UO2 namely $\sigma 3$, $\sigma 5$ and $\sigma 9$ in this DB
4. SI_gb_w_h.db: Multiple possible H bindng sites are presented here. Key `ref_id` can be used to map back to the manuscript
5. SI_gb_w_h2.db: Multiple possible $H_2$ bindng sites are presented here. Key `ref_id` can be used to map back to the manuscript
